# Example 6

# If we write code that tries to use an index that doesnâ€™t exist in a list, when the computer executes that code, the computer will raise an IndexError.




def main():
  try:
    # Create a list that contains three family names.
    surnames = ["Smith", "Lopez", "Marsh"]
    # Attempt to print the surname at index 3. Because
    # there are only three names in the surnames list and
    # therefore the last index is 2, this statement will
    # fail and cause the computer to raise an IndexError.
    print(surnames[3])
  except IndexError as index_err:
    print(index_err)
if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
